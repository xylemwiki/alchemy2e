        Alchemy 2nd Edition was discontinued in 2024 and was originally going to feature a complete from the ground reworking of <i class="b">Alchemy</i>. Alchemy 2nd Edition did not plan to have <i class="b">Potions</i> and removed <i class="b">Possession</i>, <i class="b">Scrying Pool</i>, and <i class="b">Philosipher's Stone</i>. This set was worked on entierly by <i class="b">Weston S.</i> and had no involvment from other <i class="b">Xylem</i> memebers. The expansion icon is <img src="https://wiki.dominionstrategy.com/images/6/6a/Alchemy_icon.png" width="10px">. <br><br>
        Throughout its development only 2 <i class="b">Kingdom cards</i> were every created and introduced the <i class="b">Ingredient marker</i> and 1 <i class="b">Recipe</i> named <i class="b">Growth</i>. <i class="b">Recipie</i> cards followed the color scheme [1.2, 0.9, 1.35], and they were triggered by using different ingredient cards. If you had the required cards to trigger a recipie you may choose to <i class="b">discard</i> those cards and follow the effect of the <i class="b">Recipie</i>. <br><br>
        <i class="b">Potion</i> costs, depending on the value of the cards, could have converted into <img src="https://wiki.dominionstrategy.com/images/thumb/3/3d/Coin2.png/32px-Coin2.png" width="17px"> or <img src="https://wiki.dominionstrategy.com/images/thumb/f/f7/Coin1.png/32px-Coin1.png" width="17px"> additional coins to the cost. There were a planned 30 <i class="b">Kingdom cards</i> in total for the set. The game design was not enticing and no effect for cards such as <i class="b">Growth</i> were ever made.
